# Problem Statement: Finding a Suitable Home for a Family with Young Children

I am looking to find a house that is ideal for a family with young kids. The key requirements and considerations are:

## Desired Housing Features

1. Located in safe neighborhoods with reputable schools nearby
2. Townhouses or single-family homes with access to community parks and playgrounds
3. Apartments or homes with family-friendly amenities (e.g., pools, playrooms)
4. Proximity to nature trails or recreational areas
5. Properties with fenced yards for safe outdoor play
6. Communities that offer family-oriented events and activities
7. Multi-bedroom units to accommodate a growing family
8. Easy access to childcare and early education centers

## Research Questions

1. How does proximity to good schools affect housing prices?
2. What is the relationship between distance from bus interchanges and housing prices?
3. How do rental prices vary based on these factors?
4. How does proximity to MRT stations, malls, and hawker centres influence housing prices and desirability?
5. What is the impact of flat characteristics (e.g., flat type, floor area, age, storey range) on resale price and rental value?
6. How do neighborhood features (e.g., presence of parks, playgrounds, community amenities) affect family housing choices?
7. Are there significant price differences between flats with and without access to childcare or early education centers nearby?
8. How does accessibility to public transport (bus stops, MRT, interchanges) affect the attractiveness and price of housing for families?
9. What trends exist in housing prices over time in relation to changes in amenities or school quality?

## Goal

To identify and recommend housing options that best meet the needs of families with young children, considering safety, amenities, and price factors related to location.
